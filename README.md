## Tech

- Plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JS — no build step, no dependencies.
- `styles.css` — full design system (Sora + Poppins fonts, brand tokens).
- `script.js` — shared behaviour (mobile nav, reveal animations, counters, lightbox, FAQ).
- `products.js` — **product catalogue data** (edit this file to update prices/products; the
  shop and pages pick it up automatically). Prices are indicative Naira values.
- `shop.js` — shop & cart logic (filters, search, sort, quick-view, WhatsApp/email checkout).

## Assets

- `logo.png` — original full-size logo (kept as master).
- `assets/img/logo-256.png` — optimised logo used in the header/footer (74 KB).
- `assets/img/favicon-32.png` / `favicon-64.png` — site favicons.
- `assets/img/` — hero & section photography.
- `assets/products/` — real product photos, auto-matched to catalogue items by `shop.js`.

## Updating the product catalogue

1. Open `products.js`.
2. Each product has: `id`, `name`, `category`, `price` (₦), `description`, `featured`.
   - Set `price: 0` (or omit) for “Price on request”.
   - `featured: true` shows the item in the Shop “Top Picks” carousel.
3. Product photos live in `assets/products/`. `shop.js` maps product names to the closest
   real photo automatically; add new photos to that folder and tweak the `imageRules` list
   in `shop.js` if you want a specific match.

## Deploying

This is a static site — upload the whole folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify,
Vercel, cPanel) or keep using the existing GitHub Pages workflow.

## Inventory & Business App (in development)

one Flutter codebase in [`app/`](app/) targeting Android, Windows and a PWA served at
`/app`. Backend: Supabase + MongoDB (`backend/`, credentials in gitignored `.env`).
`seed/` holds the owner-editable product import file. `preview/` is a runnable
